=======================================

You can run this program three ways:
  1) You can run the .py file with a python compiler, or
  2) Look inside the dist directory, and you will see an executable file(.exe). Run that(HIGHLY SUGGESTED)(for Windows OS only)
  3)For MAC AND LINUX USERS: once you meet the requirements, open a terminal and switch into the file directory. Copy the Python file into a different location and switch the terinal into THIS directory. Run the following command: "pyinstaller -F fibonacci.py"   and go into the "dist" directory, and you will find fibonacci.exe (SUGGESTED FOR MAC AND LINUX USERS)
I suggest the second way, but if you want you can use the first.
